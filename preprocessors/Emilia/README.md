## About ‚≠êÔ∏è
üé§ **Emilia** is a comprehensive, multilingual dataset with the following features:
- containing over *101k* hours of speech data;
- covering six different languages: *English (En), Chinese (Zh), German (De), French (Fr), Japanese (Ja), and Korean (Ko)*;
- containing diverse speech data with *various speaking styles*;
  
Detailed description for the dataset could be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05361).

üõ†Ô∏è **Emilia-Pipe** is the first open-source preprocessing pipeline designed to transform raw, in-the-wild speech data into high-quality training data with annotations for speech generation. This pipeline can process one hour of raw audio into model-ready data in just a few minutes, requiring only the raw speech data. 

*To use the Emilia dataset, you can download the raw audio files from our provided source URL list on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amphion/Emilia) and use our open-source [Emilia-Pipe](.) preprocessing pipeline to preprocess the raw data and rebuild the dataset.*

*Please note that Emilia doesn't own the copyright of the audios; the copyright remains with the original owners of the video or audio. Additionally, users can easily use Emilia-Pipe to preprocess their own raw speech data for custom needs.*

By open-sourcing the Emilia-Pipe code, we aim to enable the speech community to collaborate on large-scale speech generation research.

This following README will introduce the installation and usage guide of the Emilia-Pipe.

## Pipeline Overview üëÄ

The Emilia-Pipe includes the following major steps:

0. StandardizationÔºöAudio normalization
1. Source Separation: Long audio -> Long audio without BGM
2. Speaker Diarization: Get medium-length single-speaker speech data
3. Fine-grained Segmentation by VAD: Get 3-30s single-speaker speech segments
4. ASR: Get transcriptions of the speech segments
5. Filtering: Obtain the final processed dataset

## Setup Steps üë®‚Äçüíª

### 0. Prepare Environment

1. Install Python and CUDA.
2. Run the following commands to install the required packages:

    ```bash
    conda create -y -n AudioPipeline python=3.9 
    conda activate AudioPipeline

    bash env.sh
    ```

3. Download the model files from the third-party repositories.
    - Manually download the checkpoints of UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3 ([UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_3.onnx](https://github.com/TRvlvr/model_repo/releases/download/all_public_uvr_models/UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3.onnx)) and DNSMOS P.835 ([sig_bak_ovr.onnx](https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge/blob/master/DNSMOS/DNSMOS/sig_bak_ovr.onnx)), then save their path for the next step configuration (i.e. #2  and #3 TODO).
    - Creat the access token to pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 following [the guide](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1#requirements), then save it for the next step configuration (i.e. #4 TODO).
    - Make sure you have stable connection to GitHub and HuggingFace. The checkpoints of Silero and Whisperx-medium will be downloaded automatically on the pipeline's first run. 


### 1. Modify Config File

Change the config.json file according to the following TODOs.

```json
{
    "language": {
        "multilingual": true,
        "supported": [
            "zh",
            "en",
            "fr",
            "ja",
            "ko",
            "de"
        ]
    },
    "entrypoint": {
        // TODO: Fill in the input_folder_path. 
        "input_folder_path": "examples", // #1: Data input folder for processing
        "SAMPLE_RATE": 24000
    },
    "separate": {
        "step1": {
            // TODO: Fill in the source separation model's path. 
            "model_path": "/path/to/model/separate_model/UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3.onnx", // #2: Model path
            "denoise": true,
            "margin": 44100,
            "chunks": 15,
            "n_fft": 6144,
            "dim_t": 8,
            "dim_f": 3072
        }
    },
    "mos_model": {
        // TODO: Fill in the DNSMOS prediction model's path. 
        "primary_model_path": "/path/to/model/mos_model/DNSMOS/sig_bak_ovr.onnx" // #3: Model path
    },
     // TODO: Fill in your huggingface access token for pynannote. 
    "huggingface_token": "<HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN>" // #4: Huggingface access token for pyannote
}
```

### 2. Run Script

1. Change the `input_folder_path` in `config.json` to the folder path where the downloaded audio files are stored (i.e. #1 TODO).
2. Run the following command to process the audio files:

```bash
conda activate AudioPipeline
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0  # Setting the GPU to run the pipeline, separate by comma

python main.py
```

3. Processed audio will be saved into `input_folder_path`_processed folder.


### 3. Check the Results

The processed audio (default 24k sample rate) files will be saved into `input_folder_path`_processed folder. The results for a single audio will be saved in a same folder with its original name and include the following information:

1. **MP3 file**: `<original_name>_<idx>.mp3` where `idx` is corresponding to the index in the JSON-encoded array.
2. **JSON file**: `<original_name>.json`

```json
[
    {
        "text": "So, don't worry about that. But, like for instance, like yesterday was very hard for me to say, you know what, I should go to bed.", // Transcription
        "start": 67.18, // Start timestamp, in second unit
        "end": 74.41, // End timestamp, in second unit
        "language": "en", // Language
        "dnsmos": 3.44 // DNSMOS P.835 score
    }
]
```
